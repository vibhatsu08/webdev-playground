# webdev-playground
This repository contains the experimental code for my projects. Not a project focussed repository.
playgroundLog[1.0] - In this log, i'll be working on the Etch a Sketch project. Testing out all the stuff before i incorporate or merge it with my actual projecy repo.
playgroundLog[1.1] - Fixed the issue with grid not being limited to a fixed size and the boxes being of the same size, now, the user can enter any random number, and the actual size of the grid will remain the same, whereas the cells inside the grid, will change dynamically.
playgroundLog[1.2] - Currently working the range based number input for the grid.
